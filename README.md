# What is Codewars?

Codewars is a website that offers programming challenges (known as "katas") in various difficulty levels and programming languages. These challenges are designed to improve your coding skills and help you learn new techniques.

Each kata has a set of requirements and constraints, and your goal is to write a solution that meets those requirements and passes a set of test cases. Once you submit your solution, you can compare your approach to others and see how other people have solved the same problem.

# What's in this repository?

This repository contains my solutions to Codewars katas, organized by programming language. Each solution is contained in a separate file named after the kata, and includes a link to the original problem on Codewars.

# Why create this repository?

I created this repository to keep track of my progress on Codewars, and to share my solutions with others who might find them helpful. By documenting my approach to each problem, I hope to improve my coding skills and gain a better understanding of different programming techniques.
